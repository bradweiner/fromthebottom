## Installation

You can install the released version of fromthebottom with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("bradweiner/fromthebottom")
```

## Examples

```{r libraries, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(fromthebottom)
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na()
```


Color by discrete variable using default palette based on [Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_(album))

```{r example-default}
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_phish(palette = "rift")+
  theme_void()
```


### Choose a different palette 

[Junta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junta_(album) looks great in grayscale 

```{r example-palette}
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_phish(palette = "junta")+
  theme_void()
```


### Color by numeric variable 

Run like an antelope with [Lawn Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Boy)

```{r color-numeric}
ggplot(penguins , aes(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm,color = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_phish(discrete = FALSE, palette ="lawn_boy")+
  theme_void()
```

### Fill by discrete variable

Don't take another step with [Hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoist_(album))
```{r example-fill}
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_void()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_phish(palette = "hoist", guide = "none")
```

Or, wade in the velvet sea with [Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_the_Ghost)

```{r example-fill2}
ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_void()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_phish(palette = "ghost", guide = "none")
```

## Acknowledgements

This package was re-purposed from the excellent [tayloRswift](https://github.com/asteves/tayloRswift) package.95% of the code is a direct copy pasta and Alexander Stephenson should get credit and citation for this work. Aside from a few tweaks and new color palettes, the code is his. Errors in `fromthebottom` are mine.

I also leaned heavily on the R-Bloggers post [Extracting colours from your images with Image Quantization]( https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/extracting-colours-from-your-images-with-image-quantization) which utilizes the `magick` package to programmatically extract the HEX colors included here.

## Related Packages 

For those who work in Python, it was brought to my attention that there is a very cool package by [Josh Borrow](github.com/JBorrow) called [swiftacsmaps](https://github.com/JBorrow/swiftascmaps). 

Other inspirations for this package are the tutorial on [creating corporate color palettes](https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/creating-corporate-colour-palettes-for-ggplot2) by [Dr. Simon Jackson](https://github.com/drsimonj), which I drew on heavily. I have long used the [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) package by [Karthik Ram](karthik), which does a similar task.
